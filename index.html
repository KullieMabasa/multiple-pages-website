      <p class="mb-4">
        Christian Louboutin1 found a way to make his shoes more visible by
        adding his signature red color to the soles. This not only makes the
        shoes look more fashionable, but it makes them more memorable. And as

        Red is said to symbolise love, passion and blood, which empowers women
        and unleashes their inner confidence, allowing them to break the
        constraints of society, whilst wearing the 'forbidden shoe. '
